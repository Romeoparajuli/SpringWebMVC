<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" 
    pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<!-- 
    The page directive is used to define page-level attributes such as language, content type, and page encoding.
    In this case:
    - language="java" specifies that the scripting language used in this JSP is Java (this is implicit in JSP, but it is still a good practice to define it).
    - contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" specifies that the content type of the page is HTML, and the character encoding is UTF-8. 
    UTF-8 encoding is important for ensuring that characters from various languages (including special characters) display correctly.
    - pageEncoding="UTF-8" ensures that the source code of this JSP file is interpreted as UTF-8 by the JSP engine.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. 
    In this case, it is an HTML5 document, indicated by `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
    This tells the browser to render the page in standards mode, which ensures compatibility with modern HTML5 features.
-->
<html>
<head>
    <!-- 
        The head section of an HTML document contains metadata about the document that isn't visible to the user directly. 
        This includes the character set declaration and the document's title.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
        The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag ensures that the browser interprets the page as UTF-8 encoding. 
        UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports most characters from all the writing systems in the world. 
        This is crucial for proper text display, especially for multilingual content.
    -->

    <title>Insert title here</title>
    <!-- 
        The `<title>` tag sets the title of the HTML document, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. 
        This is important for user navigation and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
        The placeholder text "Insert title here" should be replaced with a meaningful title relevant to the page content.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
        The body section contains the main content of the HTML document. 
        It is the part that will be displayed to users in the browser.
    -->
    <h1>what is happening with the server</h1>
    <!-- 
        The `<h1>` tag represents a top-level heading in HTML. 
        Headings are important for organizing content and providing structure to a page.
        The text "what is happening with the server" is a placeholder for the actual content and serves as a title or heading within the page.
        In this case, it appears to indicate a message related to the status or issue with the server. 
        Note that the text should ideally be capitalized for proper grammar and professional presentation.
